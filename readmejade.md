# Fit For Life - Milestone 4 Project 
Fit For Life is an e-commerce website built using Django and Stripe. Fit For Life sells products and a membership which allows registered users to view fitness plans and receive a member discount. Fit For Life caters for all individuals with a selection of fitness plans from muscle building to weightloss to general fitness. The plans can be viewed on the website once a user purchases a membership. Both non-registered and registered users can view and purchase products such as protein bars and shakes. Registered users will have a profile where they can view their membership plan and previous orders.

# UX
## Project Goals
Create a fully fucnctional website using Django and Stripe that allows user to register to avail of a benefit while also allowing non-registered users the option to browse the site and make purchases. The overall goal for this website is to allow visitors to purchase products and encourage them to register by offering a discount and exclusive plans. Registered users have their own profile where they can view their membership details, view past orders and save delivery information. The design of this website was to keep it very simple yet eye-catching by incorporating in the bright orange which contrasts nicely with the black and grey used through-out the site.  I created a logo for the website and placed it on all the products as well as using the same orange colour in the product images to keep everything in theme. I used the Beba Neue font from
Google Fonts which I believe suits the fitness industry. 

## User Stories
The site was designed with three users in mind: admin, registered user and non-registered user.
### Admin User

* As an admin I want to be able to edit/update products and plans.
* As an admin I want the ability to delete products/plans.
